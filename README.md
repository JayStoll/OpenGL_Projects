# OpenGL_Projects
A bunch of OpenGL projects created using GLUT. These were all made for the my Computer Graphics class at the University of Lethbridge  

to view any of the projects:
'''
Make sure you have GLUT and GLU on your computer
have your terminal in the project file you wanna view 
run the command: make -f <name of the makefile>
run ./<name of the executable created>
'''
